# Studyspace
This is an education based app where one can create a room and start a topic so as other users can join. It is developed in django and uses the default sqlite db in django projects. 
Once a room is created other users can join and contribute to the topic.
The admin of the room can edit, update or delete the room if needed.

The admin has full control of the app and can create, read, update and delete all rooms.

Sadly its not yet complete. Updates will be added soon.
